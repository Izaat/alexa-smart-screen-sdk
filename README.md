# Alexa Smart Screen SDK

The [Alexa Smart Screen SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service/alexa-smart-screen-sdk) extends the [AVS Device SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service/sdk) to support development for screen-based Alexa Built-in products. This SDK enables device makers to build screen-based products that complement Alexa voice responses with rich visual experiences. 

The Alexa Smart Screen SDK package in this GitHub repo includes:
* The Alexa Smart Screen SDK
* A sample app that demonstrates end-to-end Alexa Smart Screen SDK functionality
* A GUI web app that handles presentation of Alexa visual responses

The Alexa Smart Screen SDK depends on the following additional GitHub repos:
* [AVS Device SDK](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki)
* [APL Core Library](https://github.com/alexa/apl-core-library)

## Get Started

You can set up the Alexa Smart Screen SDK by using the following Quick Start Guides:
* [MacOS Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/wiki/MacOS-Quick-Start-Guide)
* [Ubuntu Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/wiki/Ubuntu-Quick-Start-Guide)
* [Raspberry Pi Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Quick-Start-Guide) (Raspbian Stretch)

You can also create your device prototype by using an [Amazon-qualified development kit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-voice-service/dev-kits) that supports the Smart Screen SDK, such as:
* [Amazon Alexa Smart Screen Dev Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/alexa-voice-service/dev-kits/amazon-smart-screen)
* [Broadcom BCM972180 Voice STB Development Kit for Amazon AVS](https://www.broadcom.com/products/broadband/cable/reference-design/bcm972180_voice)

## SDK Architecture

This diagram illustrates the data flows between components that comprise the Alexa Smart Screen SDK.

**AVS Device SDK**: The SDK for Alexa Voice Service, which implements Alexa intelligent voice control functionality.

**Capability Agents (CAs)**: Handle Alexa-driven interactions; specifically directives and events. Each capability agent corresponds to a specific interface exposed by the Alexa Smart Screen API. These interfaces include:

* **AlexaPresentation** - The interface for rendering Alexa Presentation Language (APL) documents.
* **TemplateRuntime** - The interface for PlayerInfo and Template cards (such as music cards and other static cards).
* **VisualCharacteristics** - The interface for reporting the physical properties of visual display devices (such as screen resolution, window size, and supported interaction modes).

**APL Core Client Reference Implementation**: This is the Alexa Smart Screen SDK's sample app. It has two components: a sample app and a Javascript-based GUI client app.

* **GUIManager**: Interface between the capability agents and the GUI
* **GUIClient**: Manages messages between the GUI and the rest of the sample app
* **APLCoreTextMeasurement**: Handles text measurement requests from the APL Core Library
* **APLCoreConnectionManager**: Manages the currently rendered APL document
* **APLCoreGUIRenderer**: Handles the creation of APL documents
* **WebSocketServer**: Reference implementation of a WebSocket-based messaging interface

**APL Core Library Engine**: An abstract engine for Alexa Presentation Language (APL) that manages not only APL document parsing and layout inflation, but also event handling, commands, and the rendering workflow.

**HTML Rendering Engine**: A Javascript-based GUI client app and APL view host that render the visual experience on the device.

* **WebSocket**: Reference implementation of a WebSocket client
* **APL Web ViewHost**: Renders the APL document generated by the APL Core Library
* **Alexa GUI**: Reference GUI implementation 

## Security Best Practices

All Alexa products should adopt the [Security Best Practices for Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/security-best-practices.html). Security requirements for the Smart Screen SDK can be found in [Security Requirements for Smart Screen AVS](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/wiki/Security-Requirements-for-Smart-Screen-AVS).

## Important Considerations

* Review the Alexa Smart Screen [License](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT).
* Review the Alexa Smart Screen [Notice about Third-Party Components](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smart-screen-sdk/blob/master/NOTICE.txt).

## Optional Configurations

### Run the GUI client with predefined device visual characteristics and GUI client configurations

We provide 4 different sample configuration files of predefined device visual characteristics and GUI client configurations. This can be found under `modules/GUI/config/guiConfigSamples`. To enable a predefined configuration, 
You can pass any of them as an extra config file argument after the main Smart Screen SDK config file argument when running the Sample App. 

### Remote control support

Exit and back remote control functionality is minimally supported by the Smart Screen SDK. The following behaviors are expected to occur:

* Clear the rendering screen - Exit fully out of the Alexa-presented display so that no static image or layout is left.
* Release the focus management - Release any focus management that might be held.

Using the predefined device visual characteristics, Esc and B are mapped to Exit and Back respectively.
